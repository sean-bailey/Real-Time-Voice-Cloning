If you are a developer and would like to contribute to this fork, that would be fantastic!

To do so, first, select (or create) an issue. 

Request in the issue that the issue be assigned to you.

Create a fork of this repo.

Switch to the `dev` branch.

Create a branch off the dev branch of your issue number (i.e. `issue_14`)

Once completed, create a pull request against this repo's `dev` branch, not `master`. It will go through a standard review process. Explain your code, link it back to the issue, and ensure documentation is properly updated. In the case of merge conflicts, primary stakeholders will aid in resolution.

`dev` will be merged in to `master` after primary stakeholders confirm `dev` is stable for functionality, and that proper documentation for all functionality exists.
